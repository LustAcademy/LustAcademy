                **Abilities:** (NO EDGELORD GOD-MODDING BULLSHIT HERE, just what would they reasonably have, arachne can spin webs for example, succubi can change the shapes of their bodies over time)<br><br>
                **Profession:** (Their job, yours will likely be student)<br><br>

                **Limits:** (While in universe almost anything sexual can happen to students, there are real people on the other side of these characters who will respect limits so characters into your limits will conveniently just not take advantage of your character!)<br><br>

            ALL fields in this template must be filled out. If you wish to add to that, you may. Note that if you jumble things around, certain neurodivergent staff members may be unable to approve your character.

                <ul>
                    <li>The current character limit for normal users is currently 4.</li><br>
                    <li>The current character limit for Nitro Boosters is currently 5.</li><br>

            <p><b>How they got here</b><br>Some people like to argue that a character’s background should be developed in RP, but that’s not going to fly here. We aren’t asking you to reveal every little secret or life-changing event in your character’s history, we’re only asking for a brief summary of the kind of life they came from and an explanation of how and why they found out about and came to the Netherworld and joined LUST Academy.</p>
            <p><b>Copying characters and settings from existing media:</b><br>            No, and we consider copying content to include real people (who own the rights to their own likeness and identity) and mythological persons and locales in addition to the obvious. No angels from Heaven or demons from Hell, no Asgardians or Olympians, X-Men or SHIELD agents or ninjas from Konaha. No Frodo, Thor, Peter Parker, Athena or Sans from Undertale. That said, species and reference images are largely free game. <b>Make your characters original.</b>
            </p>
            <p><b>Character age</b><br>            Characters should be 16+ or some abstract equivalent that applies to whatever kind of creature they are. However, do keep in mind that reference images for any such characters <b>must</b> still follow Discord ToS. <b>NO LOLIS.</b>
            </p>
            <p><b>Oddities on Earth </b><br>            <u>Earth was 100% normal until 2015.</u> There are no demi-human races, no demons, no gods, no spirits, no secret laboratories creating superhumans, no secret mage bloodlines, or anything else of the sort on earth. If your character comes from Earth, they are of human descent (if of alternative identity). Any access they have to magic and high technology will be solely due to the short few years of interdimensional access and resulting dissemination of knowledge. In other words, it’s acceptable for your character to have “picked up a few tricks,” but there’s no chance they’ll be a sorcerer prodigy. 
              <ul>
                  <li>That said, not all humans are from Earth, and not all human worlds lack magic or crazy technology. It’s a vast ocean of worlds out there, so have fun with that, and feel free to make something up. </li>
              </ul></p>
            <p><b>Time travel</b><br>            You don’t get to have characters from Sparta or feudal Japan, nor from some future worldline where magic has taken root or earth humans have digitized and cyberized their beings. Please adapt anything that would lean on these explanations to use interdimensional explanations instead. 
            </p>
            <p><b>Furries and ferals</b><br>These are fine. Yiff the fox! </p>
            <p><b>Occupations</b><br>            Your character can be pretty much anything that could feasibly be on campus (including the on-campus mall). Want to be a barista? Teacher? Janitor? Go ahead! 
            </p>
            <p><b>Silence in the peanut gallery</b><br>            <a target=”_blank” href="https://discordapp.com/channels/363006185126887424/614758171612938250">#character-submission</a> is strictly for making and approving characters!

            </p>
            <p><b>Edgelords and overpowered characters</b><br>            No death cult members, no lone survivors of some brutal massacre, no dragon gods or red devils, no 4000-year-old half-demon, half-angel born on a blood moon who’s quiet yet aggressive and can’t be killed, etc. - We are here for fun and fucks, not melodramatic, emo power trips. 
              <ul>
                  <li>That said, a reasonably tragic backstory is acceptable. Shit happens, people have hard lives, and sometimes the player with IRL problems wants to reflect them in RP for self-insert or therapeutic purposes. Or maybe they just want their character to grow past their crippling phobia of rain. PTSD isn’t edgy, it’s a real problem. </li>
