          <p>Welcome to <b>L</b>ucy's <b>U</b>niversity of <b>S</b>cience and <b>T</b>echnology, informally known as L.U.S.T. Academy.<br><br>

            If you are here, it is likely because you have joined our Discord server and are hoping to dive head-first into some hot and spicy <b>E</b>rotic <b>R</b>ole<b>p</b>lay (<b>ERP</b>).<br><br>
            
            Please take the time to acquaint yourself with the setting and rules, as you will find that the standards and expectations here diverge quite greatly from the norm. In order to gain access to all channels, you will be required to have at least one approved character, which in turn requires that you have read the introduction and rules. Pieces of a bot command will be provided in each section, you have to put them together; please take this completed command to <a target=”_blank” href="https://discordapp.com/channels/363006185126887424/684289033735766016">#rule-confirmation</a> and input it.</p>

            <br><h4><b>The World:</b></h4>
            <p>
                This Netherworld plane, populated mainly by Demons, went through an industrial revolution and modernization in the last half-century, thanks to the rapid invention & development of harnessing pleasure energy as a power source.<br><br>
    
                Over the last few decades, thanks to advances in transportation technology, the Netherworld managed to develop portals to allow them to travel further inter-dimensionally than they previously could. This resulted in the Earth starting to get absolutely flooded with internet pop-ups selling tentacle pets and penis enlargement potions, which made humanity aware of the Netherworld in <b><u>2015</u></b>. This quickly led to the opening of trading routes. Hundreds of other planes already had established trading routes, meaning the Netherworld is flooded with a veritable menagerie of assorted demi-humans, furries, kemonomimi, aliens, angelic creatures, and many more besides.
                <br><br>
                This means that mixed among succubi and minotaurs there are shopping malls and railways with all the modern conveniences & mod-cons of life on Earth.
                <br><br>
                In fact, you’d be hard-pressed to find differences between Earth cities and Netherworld cities... until you look closer, and see that the trains are powered by seats that harness energy through pleasuring the riders, the shopping malls have tentacle massage parlors to power them and almost all stores sell some form of pleasure energy powered product.
                <br><br>
                Due to this, Overlord Lucy has opened the school to students from all across the multiverse so they can all learn demonic magic and technology, while the L.U.S.T. Staff are also benefiting from the new student’s knowledge of other technologies and magic systems in turn.

        <h1 class="header">The Rules</h1>
        <div class="container">
            <h4><b>Behavioural Conduct</b></h4>
            <p>

                <b>Read the Intro; or, Gaining Context for Everything</b>
                <br><br>
                <b>Everything</b> in this category is required reading, not just the rules. This includes the "The World" section <b>and</b> the initial introduction above it which provides context for the rule-confirmation process. If you don't read those, how are you going to make a character for the setting? It's a common mistake to think the Netherworld is some afterlife, or that the Academy is on Earth. If Luca says "you didn't read the rules" but you're certain you did, come back to <b>this</b> rule immediately and consider her statement to be shorthand for "you didn't read the introductory materials."
                <br><br>
                <b>This is an 18+ server</b>
                <br>
                Let’s get this out of the way. This is an <b>E</b>rotic <b>R</b>ole<b>p</b>lay (<b>ERP</b>) server. In a word: PORN. It isn’t even possible to see <a target=”_blank” href="https://discordapp.com/channels/363006185126887424/363910500880220160">#ooc</a> without agreeing to a Discord ToS statement of age, so don’t play dumb and act like you weren’t warned if you decide to dox yourself as a minor. 
                <ul>
                    <li>If your behaviour, appearance, or a statement you have made leads us to believe that you are not 18+, we reserve the right to demand confirmation. You will be expected to provide a staff member with your photo ID and a photograph of yourself holding a piece of paper with your Discord tag (name#1234). This will be done privately and you may redact any information except photo and age.</li><br>
                    <li><a target=”_blank” href="https://support.discordapp.com/hc/article_attachments/115000272351/thisisnsfw.png">This screen</a> is shown by Discord to every new user who comes here the first time they open an NSFW channel - it is a legally binding agreement which places liability on the user the moment they click “continue,” so we have no obligation to verify upfront and you don’t have to worry about liability if someone you know fails an age-check. </li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><b>Inclusivity and diversity</b><br>This is an international server with members of all genders, sexualities, ethnicities, religions, neurotypes, cultures, etc. - Be inclusive in your approach to this server. What goes on here outside of RP is just another part of In-Real-Life (IRL). We are all <b>real</b> people with <b>real</b> needs and real feelings and bigotry will not be tolerated - this includes things like transphobia/transmisia and “attack helicopter” memes. </p>
                <p><b>Kink-shaming (And respecting boundaries): </b><br>Set your boundaries as you see fit, and if you want to comment that you are off-put by something, that’s one thing, but mocking, shaming and ostracizing people for their kinks is not okay. <b>ANY</b> user who actively seeks out content just to point out how ‘wrong’ or ‘disgusting’ it is will be treated with contempt by staff. <b>This is a bannable offence, to be clear.</b> </p>
                <p><b>Boundaries: </b><br>Some kinks are quite definitely viewed as more ‘extreme’ than others, and content of this type will often make others uncomfortable. Here is a non-exhaustive list of common ‘extreme’ kinks, and whether they are banned outright or <b>must</b> be content warning’ed and Spoilered, wherever possible: (<a target=”_blank” href="https://preview.tinyurl.com/y8qekfzr">How to Use Spoilers</a>).

                <p><b>Disruptive or disturbing behaviours and content</b></br>Respect the server and its userbase. Do not throw pity-parties or go on about how everyone hates you, do not be an asshole to people or start fights, do not post disturbing, disgusting, or childhood-ruining content (including but not limited to “sexy SpongeBob”), do not post filth or gore content, do not post pics of IRL extremes like bloodplay, bestiality, etc. (If in doubt, check the above list or ask a Staff member)</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A genuine cry for help should always go, first and foremost, to the people who are equipped to help you handle these feelings. Below are linked some of the <b>many</b> charities who offer help for these situations. Asking on a public discord server where no one is trained to or capable of helping puts you at further risk.</li>

                <p><b>Staff relations</b><br>Don’t be an entitled brat. If a staff member puts their foot down, show some respect and heed them. We’re all volunteers, guys, we don’t get paid to put up with people’s crap. Furthermore, do not mini-mod - asking people to stop misbehaving is one thing, but if it gets problematic, tag the Staff role then and there and let the staff do their job without playing second fiddle. Further – If you feel like you could do well as a staff member, feel free to check out #staff-application-template and apply! We are almost <b>always</b> recruiting, and could use the help!~ </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Provide staff with message links whenever possible: <a target=”_blank” href="https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-">Where can I find my User/Server/Message ID?</a></li><br>
                    <li>If a staff member is misbehaving, please let someone know. Your points of Contact for Staff Member Misconduct / Abuse of Power are: <b>@flareonflare#7490</b>[Server owner] </li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>DMs and OOC RP</b><br>This is a public RP server with a certain theme and setting and a character-approval policy. DMs, private RP, out-of-character RP, and other activities that take place outside the server's established lore and setting are fine, but not the server's purpose. If you are not interested in participating in the server's established setting, it's probably best to move on – There are plenty of DM RP matchmaking servers. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You will not come in and start sending unsolicited DMs to people you haven't even met. Get to know them in <a target=”_blank” href="https://discordapp.com/channels/363006185126887424/363910500880220160">#ooc</a> first and always check their roles because not everyone is okay with being direct-messaged at all.</li><br>
                    <li>You will not use DMs to harass, proposition, or expose yourself to other members. Complaints of unsolicited nudes and the like will be met with an immediate and permanent ban and an advisement that the violated user report the offender to Discord Inc., likely resulting in permanent account shutdown. We aren't afraid to play hardball with harassment cases.</li><br>
                    <li>You will not come in and refuse to get a character approved. If you need time, that's fine, but blanket refusal is likely to get you kicked. </li>
                </ul>

                <p><b>User roles</b><br>User roles are for <b>users</b>, not characters. Present however you wish and feel free to explore the many facets of your identity or identities, but having a female character in your roster does not make you nor preclude you as a female.</p>

            <p><b>Copying characters and settings from existing media:</b><br>            No, and we consider copying content to include real people (who own the rights to their own likeness and identity) and mythological persons and locales in addition to the obvious. No angels from Heaven or demons from Hell, no Asgardians or Olympians, X-Men or SHIELD agents or ninjas from Konaha. No Frodo, Thor, Peter Parker, Athena or Sans from Undertale. That said, species and reference images are largely free game. <b>Make your characters original.</b>
            </p>
            <p><b>Character age</b><br>            Characters should be <b>16+</b> or some abstract equivalent that applies to whatever kind of creature they are. However, do keep in mind that reference images for any such characters <b>must</b> still follow Discord ToS. <b><u>NO LOLIS.</u></b>
            </p>
            <p><b>Oddities on Earth </b><br>            <u>Earth was 100% normal until 2015.</u> There are no demi-human races, no demons, no gods, no spirits, no secret laboratories creating superhumans, no secret mage bloodlines, or anything else of the sort on earth. If your character comes from Earth, they are of human descent (if of alternative identity). Any access they have to magic and high technology will be solely due to the short few years of interdimensional access and resulting dissemination of knowledge. In other words, it’s acceptable for your character to have “picked up a few tricks,” but there’s no chance they’ll be a sorcerer prodigy. 
              <ul>
                  <li>That said, not all humans are from Earth, and not all human worlds lack magic or crazy technology. It’s a vast ocean of worlds out there, so have fun with that, and feel free to make something up. </li>
              </ul></p>
            <p><b>Time travel</b><br>            You don’t get to have characters from Sparta or feudal Japan, nor from some future worldline where magic has taken root or earth humans have digitized and cyberized their beings. Please adapt anything that would lean on these explanations to use interdimensional explanations instead. 
            </p>
            <p><b>Furries and ferals</b><br>These are fine. Yiff the fox! </p>
            <p><b>Occupations</b><br>            Your character can be pretty much anything that could feasibly be on campus (including the on-campus mall). Want to be a barista? Teacher? Janitor? Go ahead!

            <p><b>Edgelords and overpowered characters</b><br>            No death cult members, no lone survivors of some brutal massacre, no dragon gods or red devils, no 4000-year-old half-demon, half-angel born on a blood moon who’s quiet yet aggressive and can’t be killed, etc. - We are here for fun and fucks, not melodramatic, emo power trips. 
              <ul>
                  <li>That said, a <b>reasonably</b> tragic backstory is acceptable. Shit happens, people have hard lives, and sometimes the player with IRL problems wants to reflect them in RP for self-insert or therapeutic purposes. Or maybe they just want their character to grow past their crippling phobia of rain. PTSD isn’t edgy, it’s a real problem. </li>
